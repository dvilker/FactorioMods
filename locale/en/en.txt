##### mode-bidi-tt

Depending on the settings and material signals, the station becomes a participant in delivery tasks.

For each type of cargo (solid or liquid), the following parameters are set:

[font=default-bold]Request[/font] — the amount of cargo that should be supported at the station. If not specified, it is assumed that the station supplies this type of cargo.

[font=default-bold]Minimum[/font] — minimum train load for this type of cargo. Trains must not run empty.

You can also configure the general mode [virtual-signal=signal-anything] — request (<0) and offer (>0) will be taken from the signal on the dispatcher's input port. To activate the general mode, a minimum value must be set for a solid load and/or liquid.

When two stations with a similar request and supply appear in the network, a delivery is created if there is a compatible train available. By default, all trains are assumed to be compatible. However, the dispatcher will not send trains with fluid wagons only to pick up solids, or cargo wagons to pick up fluids (barrels are considered as solids). It is possible to restrict the types of compatible trains in the settings below.

##### mode-depot-tt

At the depot, trains wait for delivery orders. 
Any train arriving at the depot becomes a member of the railway logistics network.

At the depot, the train is painted in the color of the station, and also receives a network mask.
The name of the depot to which the train is assigned is applied to the front locomotive.

After completing a delivery, the train will automatically return to the depot. 
It can receive a new order while en route, bypassing the depot.

Trains will always return to a depot with the same name from which it was dispatched.
If you want to have different depots for different types of trains, name them differently.

If there is a train with cargo in the depot, it will be sent to the nearest compatible cleaning station, if there is one. If not, it will wait until it is emptied.
If there is a train lacking fuel (fuel threshold is configurable in settings) in the depot, it will be sent to the nearest compatible fuel station, if there is one. If not, it will  wait until it is refueled.


##### mode-fuel-tt

If the train's fuel/energy supply goes below the minimum allowed value (set in the settings), it is sent to the nearest compatible fuel station, if there is one.
If there are no fuel stations, then the train will proceed to the depot, where it will wait for fuel to be loaded.
Usually one fuel station per surface is sufficient.

At the fuel station, it is recommended to refuel the train as soon as possible.
If the fuel station is the only station in the train schedule, then after refueling it will be sent to the nearest compatible depot, so it is convenient to build new trains at the fuel station.


##### mode-clean-tt

If the train is not empty upon completion of a task or on being sent to the depot, it is sent to the cleaning station, where any cargo should be emptied.

If there are no cleaning stations on the surface, the train will proceed to the depot and will not be used until it is emptied.


##### nets-tt

You can set the net mask bit. For example:
1 — the first network,
2 — the second network,
3 = 1 + 2 — both networks.

For delivery, it is necessary that the masks (bit AND) of the network at the supply station, the request station and the train intersect.

0 — no networks — station will not be used;
-1 — all networks.

##### priority-tt

Stations with a higher priority are used for deliveries first. This applies to both supply stations and request stations.

In some rare cases, a supply station with a lower priority can be used instead of a higher priority — an implementation feature.


##### comps-tt

One or more types of trains that are allowed at this station (separated by a space).

Train type is a string where the character corresponds to the type of car (from left to right):
L or < — locomotive directed forward,
> — locomotive directed backwards,
C — cargo wagon,
F — fluid wagon,
A — artillery.

For example:
<CC — Station will accept freight trains with a configuration of locomotive-cargo-cargo 
<CC <FF — Station will accept freight trains with a configuration of both locomotive-cargo-cargo and locomotive-fluid-fluid

Empty field — Leaving the setting blank means the station will accept any type of train.


##### informatron

The Rail Logistics Dispatcher [item=viirld-dispatcher] — is a small building (looks like a lamp) that is placed next to the station.

The dispatcher has two ports (visible in Alt-mode): input and output. These ports allow the dispatcher to receive information about the cargo at the station and transmit information about trains and deliveries.

Dispatcher operating modes:

[font=heading-2]Additional functionality[/font]

[font=default-bold]Turn Inserters.[/font] Supply stations have the ability to clear inserters by temporarily reversing them. This greatly facilitates the creation of multi-cargo supply stations.

[font=default-bold]Tamp when loading.[/font] When loading multiple goods, sometimes a situation arises that a bundle of cargo is divided into different wagons blocking the insertion of another cargo. This option "tamps" the pack into one of the wagons.

[font=default-bold]Compound deliveries.[/font] Allows multiple types of cargo to be delivered between stations at the same time.

[font=default-bold]Signals mode.[/font] Enables sending a train on a green signal at a station.

[font=default-bold]Require exact amounts.[/font] Usually, when loading, the station might load more cargo than is strictly requested (due to the size of the inserter stack). This option can be enabled when needed for additional loading accuracy.


[font=heading-2]Why should you use the Rail Logistics Dispatcher over LTN (Logistics Train Network)?[/font]

The dispatcher is optimized for multi-item deliveries: all interfering problems have been resolved.
It has a friendly and intuitive interface.
The dispatcher is very good with blueprints.
In addition, the mod is published under the free MIT license.

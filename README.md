# Rail Logistics Dispatcher factorio mod

Adds dispatcher entity for fully organized rail logistics.

The mod is in testing. No cardinal changes are expected - only improvements and, possibly, new features.

This mod has similar functionality to the famous LTN mod.

## Development

I use IntelliJ IDEA with EmmyLua plugin.
Most functions have descriptions of parameters and return values. In addition, there are factorio-api headers.
